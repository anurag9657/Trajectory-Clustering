# Trajectory-Clustering
We used clustering analysis to trace temporal change of neighbourhoods/countries. Trajectory classification enables us to understand change, which occurs along several dimensions: space, time, or literally any feature attribute one can think of. Most clustering only focuses on cross-sectional grouping. The algorithm is implemented in R language.
